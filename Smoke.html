        </div>
        <p class = "overViewText">At its core, the smoke field is a three-dimensional array of cells. Each cell has a floating point (or simply put, decimal number) representing its density.
            A compute shader then is dispatched, given a list of smoke grenades, and their radius, and loops through each cell, calculating its distance from every grenade. The reason I used a compute shader,
            over the CPU, is because the CPU can easily get bogged down, especially when dealing with big datasets like this. A three dimensional array can grow exponentially in size really quickly, and GPUs are
            made to work in parallel.
        </p>

        <p class = "overViewText"><br>We then repeat this distance calculation, but instead of smoke sources, we're now doing it for smoke destroyers. Stuff like bullets, grenades, anything else
            that can remove smoke from an area. We can subtract the destroyer distance from the distance to the smoke grenades, allowing us to carve out
            shapes.

            This data is packed into a 3D texture, where each pixel's brightness is equal to the final distance value. For this, I use a single-channel texture, and rather than
            a full float, I use a half. This massively drops the memory cost of the texture.

        <p class = "overViewText">Raymarching is a difficult subject to fully and accurately explain, but I can give a run-down of what's going on.
            The smoke is a screen-space shader, that gets the distance from the camera to both sides of a box. This is the box that the smoke exists in.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class = "overViewText">We then get the distance between these entry and exit points, and determine a number of "steps" to take through it. My method of doing this, is by
            dividing the distance by a pre-determined "step size", and flooring it. These will be our sample points.

        <p class = "overViewText">We then use a for loop, and at each iteration, use the current index to add a single step size in the camera's direction. At that point, we sample the smoke field texture
            (modified with some perlin noise to make it look fluffier, like how smoke should).

        <p class = "overViewText">In order to get lighting, we then run a SECOND set of samples, but in the direction of the sun, from the sample point. Find out how much stuff is in the way at each step, and
            then we can figure out from that how much light hit the current sample point (the main sample, not the light one. Just to clarify).

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class = "overViewText">We can then use a concept called the "Beer-Lambert law" to determine, based on how much stuff the main ray has already been through, how visible the light should be, and thus
            how much of it should be added to the final pixel. This equation is the foundation of fog and other density accumulation effects in games, as it's fairly simple to compute and is physically accurate.
            In code, it looks like this: <br><code>exponential(-densityAtPoint x absorptionPerParticle)</code>
        </p>
        <p class = "overViewText">That's the simple way of explaining what's going on. Raymarching smoke has a lot of depth to it, and new ways of rendering, optimising, and realistically simulating the
            transport of light through smoke are constantly being figured out.
