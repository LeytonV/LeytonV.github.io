            <p class = "summaryText">SUPERFRAG is a bombastic fast-paced shooter with juvenile humor that I created.
                The goal of this project was to create a fast-paced, anti camper style of shooter that had a
                focus on improvisation and unorthodox weapons, e.g throwing bricks, guns, using your opponents
                as launchpads and more. <br><br>The game was created entirely by me alone, from the design and visual style 
                to the programming, modelling, animating, VFX and more.

        </div>
        <p class = "overViewText">The game was created in Unity using C# and Photon Networking. The game follows the format of pure deathmatch, with a focus 
            on the player's killstreak by providing killstreak awards, such as a energy drink at 3 kills, akimbo at 6, and a nuke at 10 to end the game.
    
            The visuals in particular were actually inspired by Terri Vellmann's games, most notably High Hell and SLUDGE LIFE. SLUDGE LIFE is the main inspiration behind 
            the "extra" fun stuff in the game, such as the ability to spray graffiti on walls.
